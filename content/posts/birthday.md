Today is my birthday, and yet there's a slight dilemma: Who asked! But does it truly matter? At times, I can't help but feel that I shouldn't have been born; it's as though it's all my doing.

If someone were to remember and celebrate this day with me, I believe I might just find myself falling in love with them.

Why must I endure this hardship? No cake, no care, no friends; my birthday only serves as a stark reminder of my solitude.

However, during my high school years, something changed. There's one person whom I genuinely wish to spend my entire life with.
