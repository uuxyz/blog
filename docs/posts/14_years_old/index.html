			<p>This article documents the events in my life from my seventh birthday to my fourteenth birthday.</p>
<p>My teacher in the grade 3 is a very strong woman which competitive with martial art and kongfu. He has its own logic of teaching. She&rsquo;ll punish student with physical way and she didn&rsquo;t afraid to be turn in. But she will take us to grow flowers. At the day of graduation, she said, the door of Rui&rsquo;an Senior High School is open for me, what a tragic.</p>
<p>There is a phone, it&rsquo;s my aunt who bought for my mom. My mom always receive thing like bowls, cups, clothes as gift from her. It&rsquo;s a Motorola EX211 feature phone so it has barely function beyond call and receive calling.</p>
<p>Using it, I first contact with internet, I was confused with 24 points and I can&rsquo;t figure out how to do it. It has a full sheet of difficult problems, I was nearly about to cry, so my mom agree to use her phone for me to search for answer, she always refuse to use it because of warring for over change. But the browser on the feature phone is just dumb, It can&rsquo;t get out any information useful. So my father help me to do this homework and let me go to the bed early. I haven&rsquo;t talent in 24 points, so I lost the match of it in my elementary school, beyond my expectation, my math teacher didn&rsquo;t say anything. I thought he would blame me or something. I thought I was a genius but wasn&rsquo;t I. Even I join in the tan-gram match or Olympic math match, maybe I wasn&rsquo;t so talent as I thought.</p>
<p>I like its build in game like jigsaw, and it support java apps, I explore the Internet to finds some interesting java apps to make it useful, like world map, Super Mario, The ROM is very small, only have few MB, and I like use the phone to listen FM radio or the music copied from my aunt. When my mom in the hospital, it&rsquo;s really brings me a lot of pleasure. I was live in another aunt that time when my mom is ill and my dad need to take care of her, so I had to live in my relatives house whole summer vacation, all my homework almost done, expect for some poem left for reciting. I am worrying all day long for afraid to lost my mom. But eventually, she was fine, but lost all work ability in the industry. I remember that she only have 2 days off per month, if the factory has jobs overnight, all the workers will be given a bottle of beverage, such as iced black tea, green tea, milk tea or coca cola. She will never drink it, but bring it to me. My useless father thinks that my mom go home late for unfaithful, so he brings me to the factory by bike. Only found there no one here. The lights are already off. So he come back home rapidly found my mom is already home. Maybe people will twist their soul in this situation, when he didn&rsquo;t do much for the family, he will even try to find if there something her do harmed him before to balance his emotion.</p>
<p>Troubles in life, when I was young. The trouble of money is always confusing me. My family can&rsquo;t afford for a smart phone, so my uncle brought one Samsung phone for my mother and an other for his sister. We didn&rsquo;t use it at the first time. We didn&rsquo;t set up We Chat, I just play it&rsquo;s own setting and explore every function in this. There is a pattern code to lock the screen, but I can&rsquo;t solve it any more after I set it. I was trying everything to unlock it but useless. I even try to exhaustion. In the whole year, I was confused with it, I can&rsquo;t get the latest message from my school teacher, and I can&rsquo;t tell the truth of why it locked. I can only hide this secret and avoid my mom to use this phone even she is confused why. I think I was wasted thirty thousand yuan in a phone even haven&rsquo;t used. I even want to suicide to end this guilty. I hold the knife several times dream try to stub me to death, fortunately I didn&rsquo;t really do this. But one day, my mom go to the phone store to take out her old SIM card to install in this new phone in the time I didn&rsquo;t know. The counter just delete anything easily as if nothing happen. My mom use this phone later smoothly then the problem troubled me years fixed so easily that I can&rsquo;t believe.
But I later use it to browse pron videos, which costs all my mom&rsquo;s phone bill.</p>
<p>in the 2005 I got a computer, I was think that If my parents can keep watch on what I website I was visiting, technically they really can do that, but fortunately they haven&rsquo;t any technical. I dream that one day I can write my own website. I downloaded many novels and pictures from the Internet, because the I am the beginner, every resource I found is very valuable to me. I reading the novel very pleasurably.</p>
<p>I got a book I got when book sale on school for children who interested in science and technology which introduced many technology companies, including Baidu the biggest search engine in China and Google the biggest search engine in World.
I was support china first time, but the Christianity faith gradually change my faith in communism.</p>
<p>My best friend during this time is the PC, ZNX. Sometimes we fighting, but in my lonely life, I glad them show up.</p>
<p>I using Linux from that time. And I messed up my file system since then.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t join in any after school class, which makes me lack of friends. We only met in the class time, there isn&rsquo;t much time for we to build friendship.</p>
<p>2006 I graduate from elementary school with 1st score, my life seem to be start, but ends here.</p>
<p>In the junior high school, I&rsquo;m always not best. My desk-mate is XLL, who is a good student, but she always try to belittle me with her high score, which make me mad.
There is left one year for my graduation in junior high school(2006-2009)</p>
